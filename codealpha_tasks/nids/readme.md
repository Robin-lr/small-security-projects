# Snort IDS Python Monitor

This repository contains a Python-based tool that integrates with Snort to run a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The tool launches Snort in fast alert mode, monitors its alert log in real time, and prints any generated alerts to the console. This project is designed for demonstration purposes and can be further extended for production environments.

## Features

- **Snort Integration:** Launches Snort with a specified configuration file and network interface.
- **Real-Time Alert Monitoring:** Tails the Snort alert log and displays new alerts as they are generated.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Easily adjust paths and settings in the provided Python script.
- **Graceful Termination:** Handles user interrupts (Ctrl+C) to safely terminate Snort.

------

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- **Snort:** Ensure that Snort is installed and properly configured.
  - Snort Installation Guide
- **Python 3:** The tool is written in Python 3.
- **Root Privileges:** Snort requires root permissions to capture packets.

### Python Libraries

The script uses built-in Python modules only, so no additional packages are necessary.

------

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   bashCopyEditgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/snort-ids-monitor.git
   cd snort-ids-monitor
   ```

2. **Ensure Snort is Installed:**

   Follow your preferred method to install Snort. Verify the installation by running:

   ```
   bash
   
   
   CopyEdit
   snort -V
   ```

3. **Set Up Snort:**

   - Ensure your Snort configuration file (`/etc/snort/snort.conf`) is correctly set with rule paths and network variables (e.g., `HOME_NET`).
   - Check that the alert log file path (typically `/var/log/snort/alert`) is specified and writable.

------

## Configuration

Edit the Python script (`snort_ids.py`) to suit your environment. Key variables to modify include:

- **INTERFACE:** Set this to the network interface you wish to monitor (e.g., `eth0`).
- **SNORT_CONFIG:** Path to your Snort configuration file (default: `/etc/snort/snort.conf`).
- **ALERT_LOG:** Path to your Snort alert log (default: `/var/log/snort/alert`).

Example snippet from `snort_ids.py`:

```
pythonCopyEditINTERFACE = "eth0"             # Change to your network interface
SNORT_CONFIG = "/etc/snort/snort.conf"   # Snort configuration file path
ALERT_LOG = "/var/log/snort/alert"         # Snort alert log file path
```

------

## Usage

To run the tool, execute the following command with root privileges:

```
bash


CopyEdit
sudo python3 snort_ids.py
```

**What to Expect:**

- The script will start Snort with the specified configuration.
- Once Snort is running, the Python tool will begin tailing the alert log.
- Any new alerts generated by Snort will be printed in real time on your terminal.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the tool and safely terminate the Snort process.

------

## Troubleshooting

- **Snort Not Starting:**
   Ensure that Snort is installed and that the configuration file path (`/etc/snort/snort.conf`) is correct.
- **Alert Log Not Found:**
   Verify that the alert log path exists and that Snort is configured to write logs to that location.
- **Permission Issues:**
   Run the script with `sudo` to ensure it has the necessary privileges to capture packets and access system directories.
- **Interface Not Capturing Traffic:**
   Confirm the network interface (e.g., `eth0`) is correct and is in promiscuous mode if needed.
